# Binary Search Tree Visualization

As an answer to my lecturers' challenge to make any tree visualization, here I made visualization for Binary Search Tree with Javascript and p5.js library. This web app shows step-by-step algorithm with user-adjustable animation speed. The purpose of this program is to make computer science students understand all operations in Binary Search Tree, such as insert, delete, search, and print with pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Please report for any bugs.

You can use my app [here](http://bit.ly/BSTPutuPrema).
